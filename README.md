# Unix Password

This is a simple C library with OCaml bindings to support updating Unix
account passwords in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. It is not meant to
support other operations, like creating or deleting accounts. For this
you might be interested in [opasswd] which exposed the complete C API
for password handling to [OCaml].
